This repository contains all the code for the applications presented on my personal blog https://www.vincentcarret.com/ and the companion website of the book I wrote with MichaÃ«l Assous https://www.economic-instability.com/.

The applications use React to simulate the solutions of economic models developed in the 1930s-1940s. Most of the models are based on small systems of differential equations, some of them nonlinear.
